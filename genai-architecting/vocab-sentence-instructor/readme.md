# German vocab instructor

i want to build a web application that allows a user to input a topic in english and get a list of vocabs related to that topic in german. the output is a list of vocabs and their german translations. each vocab has an english version an a german version and a list of parts of the word in the german translation.

the app is built using react
the app has a single web page
the app uses gemini api to generate the list of vocabs based on the topic.
